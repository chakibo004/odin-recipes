    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Steps</strong>
    <ol>  
        <li><strong>STEP 1: </strong>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
